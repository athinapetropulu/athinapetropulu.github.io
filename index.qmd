# Athina Petropulu

I am Athina Petropulu, a Greek electrical engineer, researcher, and Distinguished Professor in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Rutgers University. With a foundation in Electrical Engineering from the National Technical University of Athens and advanced degrees from Northeastern University, my work has significantly advanced signal processing, wireless communications, and radar systems. Over my career, I have served as the president of the IEEE Signal Processing Society and have received numerous awards, including the IEEE Communications Society Stephen O. Rice Prize and the IEEE Signal Processing Society Meritorious Service Award.

From my tenure at Drexel University to my current role at Rutgers, I have been dedicated to academic excellence and innovation. I have held visiting appointments at prestigious institutions such as SUPELEC, Universit√© Paris-Sud, and Princeton University. My contributions to the field are reflected in my extensive publication record, including pioneering work on MIMO radar and joint communication systems. As a Fellow of IEEE and AAAS, I continue to push the boundaries of electrical and computer engineering through research, teaching, and leadership in the academic community.
